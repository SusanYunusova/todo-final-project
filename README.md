Todo tasking management project for managind todolist,tasks.Written for IBA tech Final-project

The idea of the project

The main idea of the project is to build a Trello-like application
that's useful for managing tasks digitally instead of writing them down on paper.

How everything should work:

The algorythm that a new user should follow consists of the following:

Open the login page, choose the Create account option
Get redirected to the Sign Up page, fill in the form and press the Create account button
Get redirected to the login page, enter the newly created credentials and press login

Get redirected to the Landing page, where the user can press the Get Started button and get redirected to the Main page (My Tasks)

Here the user can see his tasks, which he has added using the Add task button. He can also sort his tasks by selecting the filter near the Add task button. If the user presses the Delete button on a task - that task is being transferred to the Tasks archive page. However, if he clicks on the Complete button - a special Done flag is applied to the task and it can be seen by selecting the Done filter. If the user clicks on a specific task - he can see its description down below.
If the user wants to see the Tasks archive page - he may hover onto his icon in the top right corner and choose the Archive option. If the user presses the Delete button on a task here - a modal window appears alerting the user that this action cannot be undone.
